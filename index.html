        Hi! My name is Mary Schwedatschenko. I am sixteen years old, going into my senior year of HS and I live near Albany, New York. I wanted to take this class because I am really passionate about technology. I am the president & programming lead of my school's robotics team and have taken a few CS classes. My favorite TV show is Seinfeld and I like to skateboard and play video games. I'm looking forward to the next 2 weeks! :)
