            I found this meme on r/machinelearningmemes. I thought it was funny because it shows Scooby and the gang unmasking a guy labeled bad model. This means bad ai
            or machine learning model. It then shows the team unmasking them and then underneath is the guy's real identity, bad training data. Bad training data means 
            that whomever trained the model provided bad data from the model to learn from. This is good at displaying its point because it is easy for the reader
            to understand if they have a very rudimentary knowledge of ai and machine learning.
