        <h3>Cipher Search</h3>
        <p>Mary Schwedatschenko / July 21, 2023</p>

        <h4>What is your game about and how do you play it? </h4>
        <p>
            Our game was called Cipher Search, and it was a treasure
            hunt you would play using cryptology. The basic premise was that
            we made a bunch of clues that corresponded to objects in places
            around the room. The game/tricky part was that all the clues
            were encrypted.

        </p>

        <h4>What were your challenges in creating the game? </h4>
        <p>
            Our challenges in creating the game were trying to
            figure out the hard questions for the clues.
            

        </p>

        <h4> How did you solve the problems your encountered? </h4>

        <p>
            I eventually came up with the idea of using a riddle 
            and the answer to the riddle was a keyword that the player
            had to use to decrypt the clue. It was kinda complicated,
            but it came out pretty cool. 

        </p>

        <h4>If you had more time to work on the game what improvements 
            would you make?</h4>

        <p>
            If we had more time, I'd be interested in expanding the game
            by adding more clues and more depth to some of the existing
            ones. I would also like to make them kinda connect in a way.
            We were thinking about doing that at the beginning and making
            it more team oriented but it turned out to just be more of an
            individual competitive game.

        <h3>My favorite HTML tutorial</h3>
        <p>Mary Schwedatschenko / July 21, 2023</p>

        <p>
            The video below is a tutorial on how to add emojis into
            html. I found it very cool because I like using emojis in text 
            to amplify how I am feeling when I message someone.

        <h3>Meme Write Up</h3>

        <p>
            I found this meme on r/machinelearningmemes. I thought it was funny because it shows Scooby and the gang unmasking a guy labeled bad model. This means bad ai
            or machine learning model. It then shows the team unmasking them and then underneath is the guy's real identity, bad training data. Bad training data means 
            that whomever trained the model provided bad data from the model to learn from. This is good at displaying its point because it is easy for the reader
            to understand if they have a very rudimentary knowledge of ai and machine learning.
