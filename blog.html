        <h3>Strong Museum of Play</h3>
        <p>Mary Schwedatschenko / July 27th, 2023</p>
      
            <p>
                On July 26th, we went to the Strong Museum of Play for a field 
                trip. Our field trip began with an activity surrounding artifacts
                and trying to create an exhibit with the artifacts.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                My artifact was about the first Barbie CD-ROM game on PC in the 
                90s. This game pioneered the beginning of women in gaming and 
                many companies realized this was an untapped market. Video games
                marketed towards girls were never even thought about before this.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The exhibit my group and I ended up creating had the theme of
                gender inequality and discrimination. The other artifacts were
                about a settlement for unequal treatment at Riot Games, a 
                magazine that accidentally depicted the man dominated field of
                gaming, and a game created by a trans woman highlighting the 
                challenges of queer people.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                My favorite moment was when we went to the mini Wegmans. I've been
                to this museum a few times before with my dad and uncle, and 
                every time we would go out to Rochester, I would always ask to
                go back to the museum, but we never had time. Eventually, I grew 
                out of asking as I became too old to go back. I was delighted to
                get the opportunity to go back because one of the main things I 
                remember is the mini Wegmans. I think it looked a lot different
                now from 10 years ago.

        <h3>Favorite Robot Questions</h3>
        <p>Mary Schwedatschenko / July 25th, 2023</p>

        <div class = "robot">
            <img src="c3po.PNG"
            width=100%>
        </div>


        <h4>What is your most or least favorite robot or AI character from any kind of media? </h4>
        <p>
            My favorite robot character from media is C3PO from the Star Wars franchise.
        </p>

        <h4>Why is it your favorite?</h4>
        <p>
           C3PO is my favorite robot because even though he’s not a human, he is really friendly and charismatic. 
        </p>

        <h4>In what ways do you think your connection to that character influences how you think and feel about robots/AI? </h4>
        <p>
            I think my liking to C3PO helps influence my attitude towards robots. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m not really scared of robots, and I believe it’s in part to growing up watching Star Wars movies and seeing C3PO and R2-D2. 
        </p>

        <h4>
            Did that change at all when you got to meet the robot? 
        </h4>
        <p>
        No, not really. I am extremely fascinated by robots and seeing the RoboThespian was super cool to me. 
        </p>
        
        <h4>Or when you got to interact with the Midjourney AI? </h4>
        <p>
        No, I have always thought AI programs like Midjourney, DALL-E and ChatGPT are really cool. 
        </p>

        <h4>How could you be more careful in thinking about robots/AI in the future, to be less ‘lazy’ as we talked about in class?</h4>
        <p>
            Despite my extreme fascination with robots, I don’t want them to run my household and my life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I think I learned from Wall-E that humans will basically just turn into sacks of meat if we let robots run everything.

        <h3>The Perfect PB&J Infographic</h3>
        <p>Mary Schwedatschenko / July 24th, 2023</p>

        <p>
            In class today, I made an infographic using Canva, a free 
            software. 
        </p>    
        <p>
            It is about how to make the perfect peanut butter 
            and jelly sandwich by citing chefs and nutritionists.

        <h3>Cipher Search</h3>
        <p>Mary Schwedatschenko / July 21, 2023</p>

        <h4>What is your game about and how do you play it? </h4>
        <p>
            Our game was called Cipher Search, and it was a treasure
            hunt you would play using cryptology. The basic premise was that
            we made a bunch of clues that corresponded to objects in places
            around the room. The game/tricky part was that all the clues
            were encrypted.

        </p>

        <h4>What were your challenges in creating the game? </h4>
        <p>
            Our challenges in creating the game were trying to
            figure out the hard questions for the clues.
            

        </p>

        <h4> How did you solve the problems your encountered? </h4>

        <p>
            I eventually came up with the idea of using a riddle 
            and the answer to the riddle was a keyword that the player
            had to use to decrypt the clue. It was kinda complicated,
            but it came out pretty cool. 

        </p>

        <h4>If you had more time to work on the game what improvements 
            would you make?</h4>

        <p>
            If we had more time, I'd be interested in expanding the game
            by adding more clues and more depth to some of the existing
            ones. I would also like to make them kinda connect in a way.
            We were thinking about doing that at the beginning and making
            it more team oriented but it turned out to just be more of an
            individual competitive game.

        <h3>My favorite HTML tutorial</h3>
        <p>Mary Schwedatschenko / July 21, 2023</p>

        <p>
            The video below is a tutorial on how to add emojis into
            html. I found it very cool because I like using emojis in text 
            to amplify how I am feeling when I message someone.

        <h3>Meme Write Up</h3>
        <p>Mary Schwedatschenko / July 18th, 2023</p>

        <img src = "https://i.redd.it/qz0pw5wupgva1.jpg"

        <p>
            I found this meme on r/machinelearningmemes. I thought it was funny because it shows Scooby and the gang unmasking a guy labeled bad model. This means bad ai
            or machine learning model. It then shows the team unmasking them and then underneath is the guy's real identity, bad training data. Bad training data means 
            that whomever trained the model provided bad data from the model to learn from. This is good at displaying its point because it is easy for the reader
            to understand if they have a very rudimentary knowledge of ai and machine learning.
